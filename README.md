## Features

### Folder Structure Customization

-   Automatically creates essential folders such as controllers, routes, config, middlewares, models, services, and more, based on the selected complexity.
-   **Predefined folder structures**:
    -   **Simple**: Minimal structure with controllers and routes.
    -   **Advanced**: Includes additional folders like config, middlewares, models, and utils.
    -   **Complex**: Adds services and tests folders for a comprehensive project organization.

### File Generation

-   Automatically generates a `server.js` or `server.ts` file in your preferred language (JavaScript or TypeScript).
-   Prepopulated boilerplate code for the server file to kickstart your project.

### Integration with npm

-   Automatically initializes a `package.json` file with scripts for starting and developing the API.
-   Option to install necessary npm packages, such as Express, directly from the interface.

### Customizable Extensions

-   Supports both JavaScript and TypeScript, allowing users to select their preferred development environment.

### Interactive Workflow

-   Utilizes VS Codeâ€™s Quick Pick menus for an intuitive and guided setup process.
-   Offers flexibility to choose automation or manual configuration for certain steps, such as npm initialization.

### Ease of Use

-   Automatically updates `package.json` with relevant fields and scripts.
-   Prompts for optional installation of key dependencies to kickstart development.

## Requirements

### 1. Environment

-   **VS Code**: The extension runs inside Visual Studio Code.
-   **Node.js**: Required to run npm commands for creating files and dependencies.

### 2. User Input

-   **API Complexity**: Choose one:
    -   **Simple**: Basic folders like controllers and routes.
    -   **Advanced**: Adds more folders like config, models, and middlewares.
    -   **Complex**: Includes everything from the Advanced option, plus services and tests.
-   **Programming Language**: Choose between JavaScript or TypeScript.
-   **NPM Initialization**: Decide whether to auto-generate `package.json` or do it manually.
-   **Install Packages**: Choose whether to automatically install dependencies like Express.

### 3. Files and Folders Created

Based on the selected API complexity, different folders and files will be created, such as:

-   **Simple Setup**: `controllers`, `routes`, `server.js/server.ts`.
-   **Advanced and Complex Setups**: Adds folders like `config`, `models`, `middlewares`, `services`, and `tests`.

### 4. Permissions

-   **Read/Write Access**: Required to create files and folders in the project.

### 5. Dependencies

-   **VS Code API**: To interact with the VS Code environment.
-   **Node.js Modules**: For file handling (fs), path resolution (path), and running npm commands (child_process).

### 6. Error Handling

-   **Missing Folder**: If no workspace is open, an error message is displayed.
-   **File Creation Errors**: Handles and shows errors if something goes wrong during file or folder creation.

### 7. Feedback to User

-   **Confirmation**: Users are notified when the process is complete.
-   **Error Messages**: Show warnings for any issues that arise during setup.

## Extension Settings

-   **Node.js Required**: Ensure Node.js is installed to run npm commands for package management.
-   **Nodemon Required**: Ensure Nodemon is installed to facilitate development.

## Known Issues

-   **Node.js Required**: Ensure Node.js is installed to run npm commands for package management.
