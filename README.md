ðŸ’Œ ðŸ’“

he API Project Generator is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to streamline the creation of API projects by automating folder structure setup, file generation, and package management. It provides a user-friendly interface to quickly generate a boilerplate for APIs, offering options for different levels of complexity: Simple, Advanced, and Complex.

## Features

- Folder Structure Customization:
  Automatically creates folders such as controllers, routes, config, middlewares, models, services, and more based on the selected complexity.
  Supports three predefined folder structures:
  Simple: Minimal structure with controllers and routes.
  Advanced: Includes additional folders like config, middlewares, models, and utils.
  Complex: Adds services and tests folders for comprehensive project organization.
  File Generation:

- Automatically generates a server file (server.js or server.ts) in the preferred language: JavaScript or TypeScript.
  Prepopulated boilerplate code for the server file is included.
  Integration with npm:

- Automatically initializes a package.json file with scripts for starting and developing the API.
  Provides an option to install necessary npm packages like express directly from the interface.
  Customizable Extensions:

- Supports both JavaScript and TypeScript, allowing users to select their preferred development environment.
  Interactive Workflow:

- Utilizes VS Code's Quick Pick menus for an intuitive and guided setup process.
  Offers flexibility to choose automation or manual configuration for certain steps, such as npm initialization.
  Ease of Use:

- Automatically updates package.json with relevant fields and scripts.
  Prompts for optional installation of key dependencies to kickstart development

## Requirements
